# The-Busch-electronic-experiment-system
The renaissance of the Busch electronic experiment system with lots of new modules and experiments

Busch is a German firm specialised in model trains and electronic experiment sysytems.

Their extensive range of electronic experiment systems is quite impressive.
The manuals included in these sets have detailed instructions and working principles.
The idea is "learning by doing"

The principle of constructin electronic circuits is quite simple yet cleverly designed.

The system consists of a console where a potentiometer, variable capacitor, speaker, SPDT switch, meter and DIN bus are available.
The console is attached to a board system where the different component modules can be mounted.
The whole set is covered by a smoke colored lid for dustfree storage.
You can find details and pictures in the "pictures" repository.

New modules are created and existing modules are conceived so that we can still use this system nowadays as a quick and easy tool for developing electronic circuits.
This is also ideal for prototyping or testing.
